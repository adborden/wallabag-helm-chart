# Wallabag

Default database is SQLite.
You have to provide all database related values.
Check `values.yaml` to see what is needed.
 
Dont forget to set your domain name correctly.

## MySQL and PostgresQL
For MySQL or Postges the **PHP** `databaseDriver` has to set correctly as well as the access credentials.
Wallabag requires access to a root user on the database.


## NOTE
At time of development the database port has to be provided as a string.
